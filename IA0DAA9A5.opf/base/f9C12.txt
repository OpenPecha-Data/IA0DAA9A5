Praise of Guidance

You admonish the stubborn, you bridle the headstrong, you set straight the crooked, you urge on the slow-placed, the tame
d you put under the yoke, to the vicious you are forbearing; therefore you are a driver unsurpassed of men as of unbroke
n horses.

(See previous verse)

In you there is pity for the afflicted, good will toward the happy, compassion for those in calamity, benevolence to all.

Affection even to the hostile, well-doing even to the fallen, tenderness even to the fierce - wonderful is this nobility 
of yours.

If father and mother are acknowledged to be venerable because they are benefactors, what dignity should then be yours who
se beneficence has no limit?

You became as a wall to those standing at the edge of the precipice who, careless of their own good, are, as it were, the
ir own enemies.

To aid the two worlds and to help pass beyond the world you set the light of wisdom among a people in darkness.

The activities of gods and men, divided when directed towards sensual pleasures, attained unity in you, being at one in e
njoyment of the Law.

For you have granted this hospitality of the Law unstintingly to all, O Blessed One, without distinction of birth, age, c
aste, place, or time.

As if amazed and envious the gods honour with the añjali salute even your disciples in whom is neither amazement nor envy
.

Ah! how brilliant is the arising of a Buddha, cream of the saṃsāra, by whom humanity became envied of the gods!
