Praise of Pity

All this world without distinction was bound by the Impurities; you, that you might free the world from the Impurities, w
ere long in bondage to Pity.

Which shall I first extol, you or the Great Pity by which you were held so long in the saṃsāra, though knowing its evils 
so well?

Used though you were to the delight of loneliness, your time was passed among the crowd; this was brought about by your P
ity, given free course.

As a nāga is drawn from his lake by a spell, so are you drawn by Pity from the peaceful wilderness to the village boundar
y for the sake of those to be trained.

Though dwelling in deepest tranquillity you were caused by your devotion to Pity to set foot in the arts of a singer.

The magic, the Lion's Roars, the displays of your own qualities, these were the whetstone-rubbings from Pity's gold in yo
u who had spewed out the activity of desire.

Ever beneficent on behalf of others while cruel to her own master, to you alone, O Lord, was Pity pitiless.

For so it was that resolute Pity did sometimes cut you into a hundred pieces and cast you like an offering to the quarter
s in order to accomplish others' welfare.

But clearly Pity is virtuous and acts in accordance with your will; for although thus injuring you she does not offend yo
u.
